    On the day of admission,It was actually a shocker to me seeing how friendly the alumni were.
</span>
<span>
    Them taking the heavy bag from my weary arms at the gate and directing us with a smile couldn't be sweeter.</span>
<span>I also enjoyed the brief session of orientation as we got to interact alot with different ethnic groups which was fun breaking the barrier we had since on admission we grouped ourselves separately.</span>
<span>I ended that glorious day with a hot shower which i have no idea when i had last.I remember spending a whole thirty minutes just to enjoy the feeling.</span>
<h2>Orientation at AkiraChix</h2>
<p>Day 2 of official orientation was so fun. Nancy, one of the alumnis, got to teach us how to make our beds which i perfected and also told us to feel free to tell her anything. I could feel the strangeness of each of my room mates melt day by day.We got to share some of our fears and experiences and i found them relatable.I also got to improve my English.
Funny enough, my English has really improved over the last few days!</p>
<h3>Class experience</h3>
<p>My class experience has been bitter-sweet.As for the sweet,I found the lessons interesting, with almost all lecturers being kind enough to assist me when stuck. My classmates are all so sweet and willing to help.

<p>It was a bit so hard to adjust to the 'English Only' policy but i obliged myself to it when i realised there is no other way to learn it other than speaking it. I could hear myself speak broken english but kept going without shame.
</p>I couldn't stop fearing for my life when one of us had her laptop damaged on that same day. She ended up getting a huge invoice and all i could pray for is for God to protect me from such. I also got a bit stuck in GitHub lesson but lucky enough,the lecturer helped me out though she advised me to be a fast-learner.My classmates are all so sweet and willing to help except for a few who think by sharing their knowledge they might end up loosing it. My weekend was a bit uncomfortable because i suffered a serious flu and chest pain but all in all AkiraChix is and will always be a blessing.
